## Introduction

Tyro3, AXL, and MerTK comprise the TAMR RTK family. While activating TAMR mutations have not been documented in breast cancer, targeting the receptors by genetic or pharmacological means potently blocks metastasis and enhances survival in murine models [@Kariolis:2014in] [@Paolino:2014gj] [@Holland:2010wp]. TAMR ligands, Protein S (PROS) and Gas6, bind to the receptors via two independent sites, and ligand bridges two receptors to induce activation [@Sasaki:2006bs]. Both TAMR ligands contain Gla domains that are post-translationally modified by γ-carboxylation, a vitamin K-dependent process, enabling PS binding [@Lew:2014cv] [@Nakano:1997wj] [@Tsou:2014ir]. PS is important for activation of TAMRs and the compliment of TAMRs expressed can modulate dependence on PS for activation [@rska:2014dx] [@Lew:2014cv] [@Tsou:2014ir]. The complex and multifactoral activation mechanism of this receptor family has made identifying when the receptors are active, and accordingly which patients will benefit from therapies targeting them, challenging.

These receptors have diverse roles in cancer progression. In breast cancer cells, AXL expression occurs in response to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and is essential for metastasis even when the receptor's effects on the primary tumor growth are less [@Gjerdrum:2010tn] [@delPozoMartin:2015jea]. Basal B subtype, triple negative breast cancer cell lines show striking overexpression of AXL, while tumors *in vivo* show much greater molecular heterogeneity [@DAlfonso:2014dz]. Accordingly, while *in vivo* overexpression of AXL within the bulk tumor is not striking, AXL overexpression in disseminating cells corresponds to a poor prognosis, positive lymph node status, and metastatic capacity [@Gjerdrum:2010tn] [@DAlfonso:2014dz]. AXL activation also acts as a resistance mechanism to chemotherapy and targeted therapies such as those against HER2 and PI3k activation, and so may drive these therapies to select for tumor cells primed to disseminate [@Meyer:2013do] [@Liu:2009ez] [@Wilson:2014dd] [@Le:2016dm].

At the same time, TAMRs drive breast carcinoma through tumor-extrinsic processes as well. These receptors negatively regulate the innate immune system when activated in macrophages and DCs, and similarly block NK cell activation [@Rothlin:2007wt] [@Bhattacharyya:2013id] [@CarreraSilva:2013ht]. Knockout of MerTK within leukocytes, or of all three TAMRs within NK cells, potently blocks metastasis [@Cook:2013bf] [@Paolino:2014gj, Stanford:2014fl]. Specifically within the post-partum breast, mammary involution creates an abundance of apoptotic debris, leading to a prometastatic environment through activation of MerTK in tumor-infiltrating immune populations [@Stanford:2014fl]. TAMR activation ultimately also regulates the adaptive immune response by regulating DC interactions with B and T cells [@CarreraSilva:2013ht] [@Cabezon:2015gf] [@Chan:2016df]. Some specificity toward effects on metastases, rather than the primary tumor, may indicate the subpopulation of actively disseminating cells benefit most from TAMR activation[@Cook:2013bf] [@Paolino:2014gj] [@Kariolis:2014in].

Despite these many promising results largely from genetic manipulation of TAMRs in murine models, an integrated understanding of when and where TAMR activation drives breast cancer is needed to design effective therapies. Within cancer cells, the exact processes that AXL overexpression contributes to in establishment of metastases—whether enhanced survival of disseminating cells, invasion, or immune escape—has not been elucidated. Immune cells display distinct complements of TAMRs (e.g. DC and NK cells can express all three), and modulate their expression in response to inflammatory cues, likely modulating the response to and consequence of PS interaction [@rska:2014dx] [@Lew:2014cv] [@Tsou:2014ir] [@Paolino:2014gj]. While genetic studies have to date only examined systemic inhibition of receptor activation, dependence upon PS exposure likely indicates TAMR activity is highly localized to sites of interaction with cellular debris [@Stanford:2014fl] [@Paolino:2014gj]. It is unclear the extent to which systemic inhibitors exert their beneficial effects through direct breast cancer cell targeting versus promoting immune surveillance. Understanding the role of these receptors in tumor progression is critical for designing optimal TAMR-targeted therapies, knowing which patients will benefit, and combining these therapies with other agents.









A number of small molecule and biologic therapies have been developed for targeting TAMRs in cancer, but in each case these therapies have less than ideal selectivity (Fig.~\ref{drugs}) [@Myers:2015jb]. Broadly, development of TAMR kinase inhibitors is most mature, while biologic compounds may offer superior selectivity profiles. Selectivity may be essential in targeting the TAMRs: knocking out all three receptors results in viable animals, suggesting a promising therapeutic window with minimal toxicity [@Lu:2001je]. \emph{However, in no case have the selectivity profiles of these therapies been optimized to target this receptor family with consideration for the multiple roles the receptors play both in modulating tumor and immune cell signaling.} The inhibitors developed here will have the unique capacity to inhibit both Gas6 and PROS-mediated TAMR activity across the family, have quantitatively predictable signaling and PS-engagement effects, and show exceptional selectivity.

A range of small molecule TAMR inhibitors exist with varied properties. The small molecule inhibitor of AXL, R428/BGB324, is most mature among these therapies and the first compound designed as a TAMR inhibitor to enter clinical trials [@Sheridan:2013in]. Exceptionally selective, R428 inhibits AXL while avoiding MerTK, Tyro3, and many other RTKs such as Met[@Holland:2010wp]. This strategy is ideal for processes dependent upon AXL kinase signaling where MerTK and Tyro3 are not expressed. However, mammary epithelial cells frequently express some amount of MerTK and/or Tyro3, which will consequently likely act as a resistance mechanism to this strategy[@Nguyen:2014bo] [@Stanford:2014fl] [@Sandahl:2010ec] [@TZIORTZIOTI:2014uo]. Additionally, immune cells, usually expressing the other TAMRs, will be minimally affected [@rska:2014dx]. For targeting the TAMRs more broadly, a panoply of other compounds have been designed of broadly two classes---type I (active conformation ATP-competitive binding) or type II (inactive conformation allosteric binding) [@Myers:2015jb]. All of these compounds display activity against all three TAMRs but exhibit undesirable off-target selectivity. Type I inhibitors in all cases also inhibit cKit and FLT3, which is concerning due to these receptors' roles in hematopoetic and dendritic cell differentiation and development [@Waskow:2008iz, Ott:2011dn, Myers:2015jb]. Type II compounds (such as LDC1267) inhibit FLT3 and MET. Inhibition of the latter is known to show considerable hepatic and nephrotic toxicity and thus likely will limit the therapeutic range of these compounds [@Shaw:2013cx] [@Myers:2015jb].

In addition to small molecule kinase inhibitors, a number of biologic compounds have been developed to inhibit TAMR function. This includes an affinity-matured AXL ectodomain [@Kariolis:2014in], an AXL/Tyro3 inhibiting RNA aptamer [@Cerchia:2009kb], monoclonal antibodies targeting AXL [@Top:2014vv], and monoclonal antibodies targeting Tyro3 [@Demarest:2013ey]. However, none of these compounds have been designed to coordinately target activation across the TAMR family via Gas6 or ProS. Further, none of these can be expected to have potent activity against multi-TAMR/ProS-mediated immunosuppression. These have also not been evaluated in terms of their effect on ligand binding (and thus PS tethering) versus cell signaling through direct TAMR activation. As a result, the exact cell populations inhibited in each case for therapeutic efficacy are unknown.


Maximizing the effectiveness of targeted therapies has generally required pairing with diagnostic technologies to identify patients in which the targeted dysregulation is maximally active [@Smith:2015cc]. For receptors that respond to ligand concentration or have activating mutations, measuring these two factors has been effective for this diagnostic [@Baselga:2012kl]. The more complex activation mechanism for TAMRs indicate that other measurements are necessary to predict whether these receptors are active [@Lew:2014cv] [@Meyer:CellSys]. The modeling results assembled here will be helpful for determining what set of measurements will be maximally informative.
