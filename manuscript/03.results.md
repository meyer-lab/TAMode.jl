The affinity of many TAMR-ligand pairs have been measured previously[@Kariolis:2014in] [@Sasaki:2006bs] [@Demarest:2013ey]. However, each TAMR contains two distinct binding interfaces for ligand ([@fig:binding]A) [@Sasaki:2006bs]. Differences in the affinities of these two binding sites are critical to the function of these receptors. Therefore, to begin assembling a more complete picture of ligand-mediated TAMR activation, we first sought to characterize each TAMR-ligand binding interaction. In order to separate the binding of each Ig domain, we expressed and purified each Ig domain individually as a fragment ([@fig:binding]B). The AXL amino-terminal Ig domain (Ig1) has previously been characterized and so was not included [@Kariolis:2014in]. We measured the equilibrium binding of each Ig domain to Gas6 ([@fig:binding]C) to obtain the pair of affinities of each receptor for Gas6 ([@fig:binding]D). Each affinity pair suggests a distinct binding model for each receptor. As documented in previous studies, AXL demonstrates strongly asymmetric binding with an Ig1 domain of remarkably high affinity[@Kariolis:2014in]. In contrast, each MerTK Ig domain is of nearly identical affinity and Tyro3 shows reversed asymmetry of lesser magnitude ([@fig:binding]E). This suggests the potential for strong functional diversity among the three receptors.

Measuring the affinities of each TAMR Ig domain in isolation relies on the affinity of each domain to be representative of the full-length receptor. To test whether our measurements were consistent with those of the full-length receptor, we utilized previous measurements of the Tyro3â€”Gas6 binding [@Demarest:2013ey]. We applied Monte Carlo sampling of all possible combinations of affinities consistent with these binding curves ([@fig:binding]F). Our affinity measurement pair lies within the most likely region of this sampling, indicating our binding measurements are consistent with those of the full-length receptor.





### Assembling a TAM-wide activation model

% TODO: Loosen a few trafficking parameters for fitting?

Previous studies using carefully engineered experimental models have examined the contribution of ligand concentration and PS-interaction on TAMR activation [@Lew:2014cv]. However, we hypothesized that these models may remain challenging to apply in understanding the *in vivo* environment wherein multiple factors may coordinately influence TAM activation.


To study the contribution of PS, ligand, and TAMR expression on activation of these receptors, we extended a kinetic model of receptor activation used before to study AXL-Gas6 activation[@Meyer:CellSys]. This model incorporates both ligand-receptor binding interfaces identified in structural studies [@Sasaki:2006bs]. To extend this model for cells expressing combinations of receptors, we tracked expression and binding reactions for each receptor, as well as all possible heterodimer species.
