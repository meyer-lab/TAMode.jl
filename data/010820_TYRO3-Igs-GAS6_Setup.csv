"This is processed data only including associaton and dissociation stages. Each stage is 600s, for total 1200s.",,,,,,,
"Essentially this processing should align at Baseline_2, and therefore association should be normalized on Y-axis to start.",,,,,,,
"There is no control subtracted in this data, note 2 controls however, G and H. I wanted to give you both options to view.",,,,,,,
"G = T-Ig loaded, association and dissociation in buffer",,,,,,,
"H= BSA loaded, association in high conc GAS6, dissociation buffer",,,,,,,
"If necessary and see drift effects from buffer, there are ways to achieve better controls.",,,,,,,
"The exact start time for each lane corresponds to time in total run, so for example timepoint 1 in T1 is 222.21s, in plotting this in prism I just normalized this first timepoint of associaiton to 0s",,,,,,,
And every time point thereafter has 222.21s subtracted from entire column.,,,,,,,
